# Flo's nvim config

^ This is a very bad naming, because it should be called "ThePrimeagen's config". Anyhow, I'll probably add a few tweaks along the way.

## Few key points to remember

* lua is able to require any file that is stored in the `lua` directory.
* :Ex goes back to netrw (now configured to <leader>pv)
* `:so` to source the file you're in right now
